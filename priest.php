Our priest, <b>Srimaan U Ve Sriraman Kadambi</b>, joined our temple just one month after our Inauguration ceremonies in July 2002. His knowledge of Vedic rituals has helped shape our temple into a place of divine worship and peaceful meditation.

Panditji was born in Kanchipuram, Tamil Nadu but grew up in Tirupathi. He is the fourth of five brothers (all of whom have studied the Vedic scriptures). After his 10th birthday, he went to the Vedic Research Institute (also known as Veda Viswa Vidyalayam) and studied under Srimaan U Ve Sri Sri Sri Thiridandhi Srimaan Naarayana Chinna Jeeyar Swami. He lived in the Gurukulam for 15 years studying the Vedas . The last five years in the Gurukul were spent in Simachalam Devastanam, a temple located near Vishakapatalam in Andra Pradesh.

Panditji is well versed in the Sri Pancharathra Agamas, which focus on temple rituals and pujas, and the Shodashakarmas, which are the 15 types of karmas or rituals performed at home for individuals. In addition, he also knows the Sri Divyapravantham, the holy Tamil scripts authored by the Allwars.

Panditji observes very strict rules regarding diet and hygiene. This is required for all priests who perform rituals in a temple setting. As a result, he will only accept fruits or juice offered to him in a devoteeâ€™s home. He will not eat outside food. He will take uncooked rice or dhalls on behalf of the temple to offer as naivedyam.

Panditji got married to Ramyasri in January 2005. Ramyaji is also very devoted to our temple. She is always present for pujas with a happy smile and helping attitude. We are blessed to have Panditji and his wife as a part of our temple.
